# A variable is used to store data in Python.

name = "Sahil"  # To store words/text, we use quotes. This is called a string.
age = 20        # For numerical values, we write the number directly (no quotes).

x = 5
y = 10

print(age)      # Output: 20 (because we printed the variable without quotes)

print("x")      # Output: x (not 5) because quotes mean it is text, not a variable
print(x)        # Output: 5 (because this prints the value stored in variable x)

# What Is String?
# A string (str) is a datatype used to store text (letters, words, sentences, symbols).
